## What is this? ##

It's a demonstrator of a SOAP service running within an NO MVC app.

There are two Visual Studio solutions:

- nomvc-asmx.sln is the server-side NO MVC app, which also includes an .asmx

- nomvc-asmx-client.sln is a client-side SOAP app that hits the asmx


## Entities ##

just contains a very simple 'Claim' entity

## To use: ##

- start the webapp
- use the browser to create a couple of claims
- use the client to update
- verify changed in the database
